\section{Introduction}

The concepts of mixture models and mixture distributions are old hat
in the economics business. \cite{Hamilton1989} and \cite{GoldfeldQuant1973}
are a few of the pioneering works for time series and cross sectional
regression, respectively. We are also knee deep in the age of machine
learning, and it's reigning champion, the artificial neural network, has
been successfuly adapted and studied in the context of applied econometrics.
This article adds to the small body of literature that employs a specific
neural network architecture to model the weights of a mixture model. In doing
so, we leverage the highly flexible nature of a neural network but maintain
interpretability and the means to quantify marginal effects.
The model under investigation is called the Hierarchical Mixture
of Experts (HME), a class of mixture models whose defining feature is 
its conditional weighting scheme. The model's origin story traces back to \cite{JJNH1991}.
The authors use a single multinomial classifier to assign, in a probablistic
sense, input patterns to local \textit{experts}. These \textit{experts} are
almost always some flavor of regression or classification model.
The multinomial structure that assigns inputs to experts is
refered to as the \textit{gating network}. \cite{JJNH1991} employ this
mixture of experts (ME) framework to model vowel discrimination in a speech
recognization context. Extending this approach, \cite{JordanJacobs1993}
propose a gating network that allows for additional layers of multinomial
partitioning of the input space, occurring in a recursive manner. The result
of this extension is a gating network that takes on a tree-like structure,
stemming from an initial multinomial split and filtering down through additional
multinomial partitions of the input space. The hierarchical nature of this
gating network is what gives this class of model it's name: the Hierarchical
Mixture of Experts (HME). HME models nest ME models as special case. Pushing a 
little further, one additional case is studied as well. As the depth of an HME
grows, so too must the number of experts. If we have a symmetric HME network,
this growth is geometric with respect to the network's depth. With this in mind,
we propose a model where each expert is not unique, but a member of a fixed
set of experts that are allowed to repeat at different terminal nodes of the
network. We refer to this additional model as a Hierarchical Mixture of Repeated
Experts (HMRE). Figure (\ref{fig:network_comparison}) provides an example
of each of these models studied in this article.

\bigskip

This article investigates the adoption of ME, HME, and HMRE models to an applied
econometric framework, with particular attention focused on interpretation of
the gating network and robust inference of parameter estimates. The outline for the
rest of this manuscript is as follows: the remainder of this section
fills out the literature review and section \ref{sec:Model} describes
the model in formal detail. Section \ref{sec:Estimation} discuss approaches
for estimation while section \ref{sec:Inference} concerns itself with robust
inference of the estimated parameters. Section \ref{sec:MarginalEffects}
provides detail on marginal effects of the gating network. Section
\ref{sec:NetworkGrowth} develops a proceedure to grow the gating network
in an objective manner.

\subsection{Relevant Literature}

\cite{WaterhouseRobinson1995} puts forth a method to grow an HME from a 
single split from the root node. The authors are influenced by the growing
technique used for classification and regression trees (\cite{CART1984}) and
apply it to an HME structure. Once the gating structure to an HME tree has
been grown, the authors put forth an additional trimming algorithm as well.
\cite{FFW1997} consider (\cite{WaterhouseRobinson1995}) and alter their
growing algorithm with a mind to scaling the model to handle thousands of
experts.

\cite{JordanXuConverge1995} An extended discussion on the convergence of the
model used by \cite{JordanJacobs1993} ? (VERIFY). The authors also suggest
algorithmic improvements to help with estimation.

\cite{JiangTanner1999} discuss convergence rates of an HME model where experts
are from the exponential family with generalized linear mean functions.

\cite{JiangTanner2000} provide regularity conditions on the HME structure for
for a mixture of general linear models estimated by maximum likelihood to
produce consistent and asymptotically normal estimates of the mean response.
The conditions are validated for poisson, gamma, gaussian, and binomial experts.


\subsection{Don't leave behind time series analysis}

\cite{WMS1995} provides a detailed discussion about examining ME applied in
a time series context and provide valuable insights to avoid overfitting the
model to the data, a common problem in neural network applications.

\cite{HuertaJiangTanner2003} Extends \cite{WMS1995} to an HME.
Five and a half decades of monthly US Industrial Production
Index data. They allowed the series to choose between two models, one modeled
as a random walk and the other as trend stationary. In addition, they present a
Bayesian approach to estimation.

\cite{CarvalhoTanner2003} lay out the necessary regularity conditions to perform
hypthesis tests on stationarity MoE time series of generalized linear models (HoE-GLM)
using Wald tests. The dual cases of a well-specificed and a miss-specified model
are considered. The authors restrict their analysis to MoE-GLM models involving
lagged dependent and lagged external covariate variables only. Generazlization to
include lagged conditional mean values is left for another time.

\cite{CarvalhoTanner2005} is similar to \cite{CarvalhoTanner2003} but applied
in a purely auto-regressive context restricted to gaussian models. The authors
extend arguments in \cite{CarvalhoTanner2003} to non-stationary series and
provide simulated evidence that using the BIC is helpful in selecting the 
approprite number of experts to include.

\cite{CarvalhoTanner2006} refocus the discussion on MoE of time series
regressions restricted to exponential family distributions. Distilling
the available literature at the time, the authors cover the important
topics of estimation and asymptotic properties in the maximum likelihood
framework, selection of the number of experts, model validation and
fitting.

\cite{CarvalhoSkoulakis2010} Applies mixture-of-experts of a single time series.
Using stock returns, the authors structure the gating network using lagged
dependent variabels and an 'external' covariate capturing a measure of the
trade volume at that time. THIS NEEDS A LOT MORE...Mention Simulations...READ 
THIS ONE AGAIN

\section{Model} \label{sec:Model}

We start by presenting the HME as a standard mixture model.
For a given input and output pair $(X_{t}, Y_{t})$, each expert
provides a probablistic model relating input $X_{t}$ to output
$Y_{t}$:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ConditionalDistribution}
  P^{m}_{t} \equiv P^{m}(Y_{t}|X_{t}, \boldsymbol{\beta}^{m}), \quad m = 1,2,...,M
\end{equation}

where $m$ is one of the $M$ component experts in the mixture. The experts
are combined with associated weights into a mixture distribution

\begin{equation} \label{eq:staticmixture}
  P(Y_{t} | X_{t}; \, \boldsymbol{\beta}) = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \expmixwt(m|t) P^{m}(Y_{t} | X_{t}, \boldsymbol{\beta}^{m})
\end{equation}

Here, $\expmixwt_{t}(m)$ is the probability that the input unit $t$ belongs
to expert $m$ and has the usual restrictions: $0 \leq \expmixwt(m|t) \leq 1$
for each $m$ and $\sum_{m} \expmixwt(m|t) = 1$. The gating network of the model
applies a particular functional form to model $\expmixwt(m|t)$, which includes a
second set of covariates $Z_{t}$ and parameter vector $\boldsymbol{\omega}$:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:mixture}
  P(Y_{t} | X_{t}, Z_{t}; \, \boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{\omega}) = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \expmixwt(m | Z_{t}; \boldsymbol{\omega}) P^{m}(Y_{t} | X_{t}, \boldsymbol{\beta}^{m})
\end{equation}


\subsection{Gating Network and $\expmixwt(m | Z, \boldsymbol{\omega})$} \label{subsec:GatingNetwork}

The gating network model is structured as a collection of nodes in a tree
structure that branches out in successive layers. The location of these nodes will
be referred to by their address $a$. The root node resides at the apex of the tree
and has the address $0$. The root node then splits into $J$ different nodes,
one level down the tree. The addresses for these $J$ new nodes are 
$1|0, 2|0, ..., J|0$. This type of naming convention continues as the
rest of network is traversed. At its most general, each gating node can yield an
arbitrary number of splits. While a fully generalized gating network is
conceptually attractive, it presents practical challenges for implementation.
In this paper we address several architectures for the gating network, each
with its own set of structural restrictions on the shape of the network and
the number of splits each gating node can take. For arbitary node at address $a$,
we use a multinomial logistic regression to model the split in direction $i$ to be:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:softmax}
  g^{a,i}_{t} \equiv g^{a,i}_{t}(Z_{t}, \boldsymbol{\omega}^{a}) = \frac{\exp(Z_{t} \ \boldsymbol{\omega}^{a,i})}{\sum^{J}_{j=1} {\exp(Z_{t} \ \boldsymbol{\omega}^{a,j})}}
\end{equation}

The parameters in equation (\ref{eq:softmax}) are subject to the usual
identification restrictions. For the remainder of the article, we choose
to set $\boldsymbol{\omega}^{a,J} = \boldsymbol{0}$ for every gating node.
It is important to keep track of the product path an input vector travels from
one node to another. If the observation index is supressed, the product path
from one node (say the root node $0$) to another (say $m|\ldots|j|i$)
can be defined as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:gpath}
  \gateprod{g^{0}}{g^{k|\ldots|j|i|0}} =
    \begin{cases} 
       g^{0, \, i} \, g^{i|0, \, j} \ldots g^{\dots|j|i|0, \, k} & \textrm{if path is feasible} \\
       1 & \textrm{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

If one of the nodes is an expert, then we can define the mixture weight
of expert $m$ for input pattern $i$ to be the product of the path taken
from the root node to expert $m$:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:gpath2}
  \expmixwt(m | Z, \boldsymbol{\omega}) = \gateprod{g^{0}}{P^{m}}
\end{equation}

For network architectures with multiple paths from the root node to
the same expert (see bottom right of figure (\ref{fig:network_comparison})),
we can index these multiples paths by $l$ so that:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:pathsums}
  \expmixwt(m | Z_{t}, \boldsymbol{\omega}) = \shortsum{l} \sumgateprod{g^{0}}{P^{m}}{l} 
\end{equation}


By collecting--and summing--all possible paths from the root node to each
expert, the conditional probability given in equation (\ref{eq:mixture}) can be
expanded and expressed as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:contribution}
  \begin{split}
    P(Y_{t}|X_{t}, Z_{t}; \boldsymbol{\omega}, \boldsymbol{\beta}) =& \sum_{m} \expmixwt(m | Z_{t}, \boldsymbol{\omega}) P^{m}(Y_{t}|X_{t},\beta^{m}) \\ 
      =& \sum_{m} P^{m}(Y_{t}|X_{t}, \beta^{m}) \shortsum{l} \sumgateprod{g^{0}}{P^{m}}{l}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

The product of these individual probabilities across the full sample size $T$ yields
the likelihood function.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:likelihood}
  \mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta}| Y, X, Z) = \prod_{t}\sum_{m}P^{m}(Y_{t}|X_{t}, \beta^{m}) \shortsum{l} \sumgateprod{g^{0}}{P^{m}}{l}
\end{equation}

And taking its log yields to log likelihood

\begin{equation} \label{eq:loglikelihood}
  \boldsymbol{l}(\boldsymbol{\theta}|Y, X, Z) = \sum_{t}\log\sum_{m}P^{m}(Y_{t}|X_{t},\beta^{m}) \shortsum{l} \sumgateprod{g^{0}}{P^{m}}{l}
\end{equation}

The functional form of the log likelihood (\ref{eq:loglikelihood}) does not
lend itself easily to direct optimization, but a well established
technique using expectation maximization (\cite{EM_DLR1977}) to estimate mixture
models is available. This was the primary insight of \cite{JordanJacobs1993}'s
original paper.


\section{The EM Set-Up} \label{sec:Estimation}

The EM approach to estimating an HME model starts by suggesting that if a
resarcher had perfect information, each input vector $X_{t}$ could be matched
to the expert $P^{m}$ that generated it with certainty. If a set of indicator
variables is introduced that captures this certainty, an \textit{augmented}
version of the likelihood in equation (\ref{eq:likelihood}) can be put forward.
Define the indicator set as:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:indicator}
  I_{t}(m) = \begin{cases} 
     1 & \textrm{if input vector $X_{t}$ is generated by expert $m$} \\
     0 & \textrm{otherwise}
             \end{cases}
\end{equation}

We can then reformulate the likelihood equation

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:auglikelihood}
  \mathcal{L}_{c}(\boldsymbol{\theta}|Y, X, Z) = \prod_{t} \prod_{m} \left[ P^{m}(Y_{t}|X_{t},\beta^{m}) \shortsum{l} \sumgateprod{g^{0}}{P^{m}}{l} \right]^{I_{t}(m)}
\end{equation}

leading to the complete-data log-likelihood

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:augloglikelihood}
  \boldsymbol{l}_{c}(\boldsymbol{\theta}|Y, X, Z) = \sum_{t} \sum_{m} I_{t}(m) \left[\log P^{m}(Y_{t}|X_{t},\beta^{m}) + \log \shortsum{l} \sumgateprod{g^{0}}{P^{m}}{l} \right]
\end{equation}

As mentioned previously, summing over multiple paths $l$ in equation
(\ref{eq:augloglikelihood}) is only necessary in the HMRE case. For the ME
and HME cases, $l = 1$, simplifying the second log in (\ref{eq:augloglikelihood})
to $\log(\gateprod{g^{0}}{P^{m}})$. Going forward, we will focus our analysis on
the ME and HME specifications with work on the HMRE case arriving in subsequent
iterations of the article.


%In previous works, each terminal node of thevtree was usually its own unique
%expert. This assumption would simplify equation (\ref{eq:likelihood})
%by removing the summation of the gating paths to expert $m$ into a 
%single path,
%$\prod_{t}\prod_{m}[P^{m}(Y_{t}|X_{t}, Z_{t}, \beta^{m}) \pi_{n_{0} \longleftrightarrow P^{m}}]^{I_{t}(m)}$,
%simplifying its value and the value of it's gradient and hessian. This paper
%allows the analyst to specify the number of experts before optimization,
%adding a bit more control over the mixture model but at the cost of a more
%complicated complete likelihood function. In fact this paper will test whether
%this can lead to any improvements, specifically the concers regarding overfitting
%(see \cite{BishopSvenson2003} for more references on this) when an expert latches
%on to a single observation, producing a singularity in the likelihood function.


\subsection{E-Step}
The E-step of the algorithm performs an expectation over the complete
log-likelhood equation (\ref{eq:augloglikelihood}), where the expectation
includes the additional information contained in the expert regressions.
One of the results of this expectation is the creation of second set of
weights $h^{a}$ that parallel the weights from the gating network $g^{a}$
discussed in section (\ref{subsec:GatingNetwork}). For an HME model:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Estep}
  \begin{split}
  Q(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = \mathbb{E} \left [ \boldsymbol{l}_{c}(\boldsymbol{\theta}|Y,X,Z) \right] & = \sum_{t}\sum_{m} \mathbb{E} \left[ I_{t}(m) \right] \left[ \log P^{m}(Y_{t}|X_{t}, \beta^{m}) + \log \gateprod{g^{0}_{t}}{P^{m}_{t}} \right] \\ 
   & = \sum_{t} \sum_{m} \gateprod{h^{0}_{t}}{P^{m}_{t}} \left[ \log P^{m}(Y_{t}|X_{t},\beta^{m}) + \log \gateprod{g^{0}_{t}}{P^{m}_{t}} \right]
 \end{split}
\end{equation}

Here $\gateprod{h^{0}}{h^{k,\dots|j|i|0}}$ is analagous to equation (\ref{eq:gpath})

\begin{equation} \label{eq:hpath}
  \gateprod{h^{0}}{h^{k|\ldots|j|i|0}} =
    \begin{cases} 
       h^{0, \, i} \ h^{i|0, \, j} \ldots h^{\dots|j|i|0, \, k} & \textrm{if path is feasible} \\
       1 & \textrm{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

and the $h^{a, i}$ are arrived at using bayes' theoreom.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:posteriornode}
  \h{a,i}{t} = \frac{P^{m}_{t} \gateprod{g^{a,i}_{t}}{P^{m}_{t}}}{ \shortsum{k} P^{k}_{t} \gateprod{g^{a, j \neq i}_{t}}{P^{k}_{t}}}
\end{equation}

So, now we have two different forms of weights, $g$'s and $h$'s. The
way the $g$'s are formed in equation (\ref{eq:softmax}), they are only
functions of the nodes in the gating network, separate from the
expert regressions and the information they contain. For this reason,
the authors in Jacob et. al. 1993 refer to $g$'s as \textit{priors}.
The $h$'s draw from both the gating network and the expert regressions and
are referred to as \textit{posterior} weights.

One property that $\gateprod{h^{0}}{P^{m}}$ enjoys is for any
node $a$ that belongs to the gate path from the root node
to expert $m$, then:

\begin{equation}
  \gateprod{h^{0}}{P^{m}} = \gateprod{h^{0}}{h^{a}} \, h^{a,i}
\end{equation}

so that when at node $a$, split $i$ is the direction needed in order to
reach expert $m$.

\subsection{M-Step}

Note that the paramters governing the experts and the gating network in
equation (\ref{eq:Estep}) are additively seperable. Taking each in turn, the
Jacobian of the gating portion of equation (\ref{eq:Estep}) is:







\section{Inference} \label{sec:Inference}

The score vector:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:gateScore}
  \boldsymbol{S}_{t}(\boldsymbol{\omega}^{a, i}) \equiv \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \boldsymbol{\omega}^{a,i}} = \gateprod{h^{0}_{t}}{h^{a}_{t}} \left[h^{a, i}_{t} - g^{a, i}_{t} \right] Z_{t}
\end{equation}

With

\begin{equation}
  \boldsymbol{S}_{t}(\boldsymbol{\omega}^{a}) = \left[\boldsymbol{S}_{t}(\boldsymbol{\omega}^{a, 1}),
                                                      \boldsymbol{S}_{t}(\boldsymbol{\omega}^{a, 2}),

\end{equation}

And

With

And

Leading to the sandwich estimator:

\section{HMRE}


Score function for HMRE

\begin{equation} \label{eq:gateJacobian}
  \begin{split}
    \frac{\partial Q}{\partial \omega^{a,i}_{p}} =& \sum_{t} \sum_{m=1}  \frac{h^{0,m}_{t}}{\sum_{l} \pi_{n^{0}_{t} \overset{l}{\longleftrightarrow} P^{m}_{t}}} \sum_{l} \frac{\partial \pi_{n^{0}_{t} \overset{l}{\longleftrightarrow} P^{m}_{t}}}{\partial \omega^{a,i}_{p}} \\
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

Where we have the ratio of the posterior $h^{0,m}$ and prior 
$\sum_{l} \pi_{n^{a} \overset{l}{\longleftrightarrow} P^{m}}$ weights with resepect
to the root node and the gradient of the posterior weight with respect to the node
in questions $\frac{\partial g^{a,m}}{\partial \omega^{a,i}_{p}}$. Since
$\pi_{n^{a} \overset{l}{\longleftrightarrow} P^{m}}$ is a product of values, the
partial in equation (\ref{eq:gateJacobian}) is simply that same product chain but
absent of node $g^a$ times the partial of node $g^a$ with respect to
$\omega^{a,i}_{p}$.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:gatechainpartial}
  \frac{\partial \pi_{n^{0}_{t} \overset{l}{\longleftrightarrow} P^{m}_{t}}}{\partial \omega^{a,i}_{p}} = [\pi_{n^{0}_{t} \overset{l}{\longleftrightarrow} P^{m}_{t}} (-g^{a})] \frac{\partial g^{a, j(l)}}{\partial \omega^{a, i}}
\end{equation}



Hessian for HMRE
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \frac{\partial^{2} Q}{\partial \omega^{a,i}_{p} \partial \omega^{a',j}_{q}} =& \sum_{t} \sum_{m} \left[  \frac{h^{0,m}_{t}}{\sum_{l} \pi_{n^{0}_{t} \overset{l}{\longleftrightarrow} P^{m}_{t}}} \frac{\partial \pi_{n^{0}_{t} \overset{l}{\longleftrightarrow} P^{m}_{t}}}{\partial \omega^{a,i}_{p}} - \left( \frac{h^{0,m}_{t}}{\sum_{l} \pi_{n^{0}_{t} \overset{l}{\longleftrightarrow} P^{m}_{t}}} \right)^{2} \sum_{l} \sum_{l'} \frac{\partial \pi_{n^{0}_{t} \overset{l}{\longleftrightarrow} P^{m}_{t}}}{\partial \omega^{a,i}_{p}}  \frac{\partial \pi_{n^{0}_{t} \overset{l'}{\longleftrightarrow} P^{m}_{t}}}{\partial \omega^{a',j}_{q}} \right]
  \end{split}
\end{equation}


Posterior node for HMRE
\begin{equation} 
  h^{a,m}_{t} = \frac{P^{m}_{t} \shortsum{l} \sumgateprod{g^{a}_{t}}{P^{m}_{t}}{l}}{\sum_{k} P^{k} \shortsum{l} \sumgateprod{g^{a}_{t}}{P^{k}_{t}}{l}}
\end{equation}



\section{Marginal Effects} \label{sec:MarginalEffects}

To explore what kind of marginal effects each variable has on the mixture's 
output, we start with equation (\ref{eq:mixture}) but replace the
expert distributions $P^{m}_{t}$ with the functional form of the 
expert regression $f^{m}_{t}$ and use the relationship in equation
(\ref{eq:gpath2}). 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:mixture2}
  f_{t} = f(Y_{t} | X_{t}, Z_{t}; \, \boldsymbol{\beta}, \boldsymbol{\omega}) = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \gateprod{g^{0}_{t}}{f^{m}_{t}} f^{m}(Y_{t} | X_{t}, \boldsymbol{\beta}^{m})
\end{equation}

The functional form of the marginal effect depends if the variables are
exclusive to the gating network, $Z$, exclusive to the expert
regressions, $X$, or is present in both sets of covariates,
$W \subset X$ and $W \subset X$. For covariates
exclusive to the gating network, their marginal effects are:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ME_gating}
  \frac{\partial f_{t}}{\partial Z} = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \frac{\partial \gateprod{g^{0}_{t}}{f^{m}_{t}}}{{\partial Z}}f^{m}_{t}
\end{equation}

For covariates exclusive to the expert regressions, their marginal effects
are:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ME_expert}
  \frac{\partial f_{t}}{\partial X} = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \gateprod{g^{0}_{t}}{f^{m}_{t}} \frac{\partial f^{m}_{t}}{{\partial X}}
\end{equation}

And covariates in both:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ME_both}
  \frac{\partial f_{t}}{\partial W} = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \left\{ \frac{\partial \gateprod{g^{0}_{t}}{f^{m}_{t}}}{{\partial W}}f^{m}_{t} + \gateprod{g^{0}_{t}}{f^{m}_{t}} \frac{\partial f^{m}_{t}}{{\partial W}} \right\}
\end{equation}

Just as for logistic and multinomial regressions, the
marginal effect of the entire gating network has a closed form solution.
Independently, looking at the network's marginal effects provides a sense
of what gating variables play a decisive role in directing input patterns
to the appropriate expert regressions. Starting with equation
(\ref{eq:gpath}), we take the partial with respect to gating matrix $Z_{t}$.

\begin{equation}
  \delta^{m} \equiv \frac{\partial \gateprod{g^{0}}{f^{m}}}{\partial Z} = \frac{\partial g^{0, i} g^{i|0, j} \cdots g^{k|\cdots|j|i|0, m}}{\partial Z}
\end{equation}

Applying the product rule gives us:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:hme_gate_marginal_effect}
  \begin{split}
    \delta^{m} &= \frac{\partial g^{0, i}}{\partial Z} g^{i|0, j} \cdots g^{k|\cdots|j|i|0, m} \\
                                     &+ g^{0, i} \frac{\partial g^{i|0, j}}{\partial Z} \cdots g^{k|\cdots|j|i|0, m} + \dots \\
                                     &+ g^{0, i} g^{i|0, j} \cdots \frac{\partial g^{k|\cdots|j|i|0, m}}{\partial Z} \\
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

and since:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:gate_marginal_effect}
  \frac{\partial g^{a, i}}{\partial Z} = g^{a, i} \left( \boldsymbol{\omega}^{a, i} - \sum_{j} g^{a, j} \boldsymbol{\omega}^{a, j} \right) = g^{a, i} \left( \boldsymbol{\omega}^{a, i} - \mean{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^{a} \right)
\end{equation}

we can substitute equation (\ref{eq:gate_marginal_effect}) into
(\ref{eq:hme_gate_marginal_effect}) to arrive at:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:marginal_effects}
  \delta^{m} = \gateprod{g^{0}}{P^{m}} \left(\boldsymbol{\omega}^{0, i} + \boldsymbol{\omega}^{i|0, j} + \cdots + \boldsymbol{\omega}^{k|\cdots|j|i|0, m} - \left( \mean{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^{0} + \mean{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^{i|0} + \cdots + \mean{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^{k|\cdots|j|i|0} \right) \right)
\end{equation}

\bigskip 

Standard errors for these marginal effects can be estimated using the
delta method. \textit{(Edit: These are actually only for the gating network, not
the entire mixture output. Also, this is only appropriate for MoE, not an
HME)}

\newcommand{\deltavar}{%
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \boldsymbol{V}(\boldsymbol{\omega}^{0}) & \boldsymbol{0}                            & \boldsymbol{0}                            & \dots  \\ 
    \boldsymbol{0}                          & \boldsymbol{V}(\boldsymbol{\omega}^{1|0}) & \boldsymbol{0}                            & \dots  \\
    \boldsymbol{0}                          & \boldsymbol{0}                            & \boldsymbol{V}(\boldsymbol{\omega}^{2|0}) &        \\
    \vdots                                  & \vdots                                    &                                           & \ddots \\
  \end{bmatrix}
}

\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{V}(\boldsymbol{\delta^{m}}) = \left(\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\delta}^{m}}{\partial \boldsymbol{\omega}} \right) \deltavar  \left(\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\delta}^{m}}{\partial \boldsymbol{\omega}} \right)^{\top}
\end{equation}

where $\boldsymbol{V}(\boldsymbol{\omega}^{a})$ is the sandwich estimator
in equation (\ref{eq:robustgatevarcov}) and:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\delta}^{m}}{\partial \boldsymbol{\omega}^{a,p}} = [1 - g^{a, p}] (\delta^{m} Z + \gateprod{g^{0}}{P^{m}}) - g^{a,p} \gateprod{g^{0}}{P^{m}} [\omega^{a,p} - \mean{\omega}^{a}] Z
\end{equation}

if $\boldsymbol{\omega}^{a,p}$ appears in the path of $\gateprod{g^{0}}{P^{m}}$, or if not,
then:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial \boldsymbol{\delta}^{m}}{\partial \boldsymbol{\omega}^{a,p}} = -g^{a, p} (\delta^{m} Z + \gateprod{g^{0}}{P^{m}}) - g^{a,l} \gateprod{g^{0}}{P^{m}} [\omega^{a,p} - \mean{\omega}^{a}] Z
\end{equation}

\section{Miscellaneous}

\subsection{Odd Facts}

Variables that appear in the gating network but not in the expert regressions
are sometimes called Concomitant Variables (see R FlixMix package).

\subsection{Wald Test is Invalid}
S+plus GLM section on problems with binomial GLMs
  -- Hauck and Donner (1977) JASA. Quoting S+plus: If there are
  some $\hat{\beta}_{i}$ that are large, the curvature of the log-likelihood at
  $mathbf{\hat{\beta}}$ can be much less than near $\beta_{i}=0$, and so the Walk
  approximation understimates the change in log-likelihood on setting $\beta_{i}=0$.
  This happens in such a way that as $|\hat{\beta}_{i}| \rightarrow \infty$. Thus
  highly significant coefficients according to the likelihood ratio test may have
  non-significant t ratios ............. There is one fairly common circumstance
  in which both convergence problems and the Hauek-Donner phenomenon can occur.
  This is when the fitted probs are extremely close to zero or one.



\section{Diagnostics}
pg 7 of \cite{WMS1995} suggested observing the distribution of the terminal
$g_{i}$. If only one expert is responsible for each observations, $g_{i}$ will
be close to one for a single expert and near zero for all other experts.
Can we formalize this comparison in to a specific test?

density forecasts evaluations.

Standard likelihood-ratio test is not valid (\cite{CarvalhoTanner2006}) with
AIC/BIC/VOUNG test being prefered.
