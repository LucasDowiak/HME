  ABSTRACT = {The Hierarchical Mixture of Experts (HME) is a well-known tree-structured model for regression and classification, based on soft probabilistic splits of the input space. In its original formulation its parameters are determined by maximum likelihood, which is prone to severe over-fitting, including singularities in the likelihood function. Furthermore the maximum likelihood framework offers no natural metric for optimizing the complexity and structure of the tree. Previous attempts to provide a Bayesian treatment of the HME model have relied either on local Gaussian representations based on the Laplace approximation, or have modified the model so that it represents the joint distribution of both input and output variables, which can be wasteful of resources if the goal is prediction. In this paper we describe a fully Bayesian treatment of the original HME model based on variational inference. By combining `local' and `global' variational methods we obtain a rigorous lower bound on the marginal probability of the data under the model. This bound is optimized during the training phase, and its resulting value can be used for model order selection. We present results using this approach for data sets describing robot arm kinematics.},

This includes the specification of the model based on simple statistical tests: linearity testing against smooth transition autoregression, determining the delay parameter and choosing between LSTAR and ESTAR models are discussed. Estimation by nonlinear least squares is considered as well as evaluating the properties of the estimated model. The proposed techniques are illustrated by examples using both simulated and real time series},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop a classical approach to model selection. Using the Kullback-Leibler Information Criterion to measure the closeness of a model to the truth, we propose simple likelihood-ratio based statistics for testing the null hypothesis that the competing models are equally close to the true data generating process against the alternative hypothesis that one model is closer. The tests are directional and are derived successively for the cases where the competing models are non-nested, overlapping, or nested and whether both, one, or neither is misspecified. As a prerequisite, we fully characterize the asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic under the most general conditions. We show that it is a weighted sum of chi-square distribution or a normal distribution depending on whether the distributions in the competing models closest to the truth are observationally identical. We also propose a test of this latter condition.},
